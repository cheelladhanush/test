    <section id="section2"><h2>Experience</h2><br>
    <p>"I have extensive experience in manual testing, specifically as a functional tester 
        for a banking application. In this role, I was responsible for ensuring that all features of the app 
        functioned as intended, creating detailed test cases, and identifying any issues that could affect the user experience. 
        My focus was on verifying the core functionalities, such as transaction processing, security features, and user interface 
        interactions, ensuring the application met the required standards. Alongside my testing expertise, I have also learned JavaScript, 
        HTML, and CSS, which has enhanced my understanding of web development and enables me to collaborate effectively with developers to improve 
        both the functionality and performance of applications."</p></section>
